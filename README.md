# portfolio-js
An attempt to make a website like Linkedin, but reduced in functionality and complexity.

I needed it for a university subject, Testing and Quality Assurance. I had to test my own product, so i decided to make a dummy project which i will be able to test.

I finished the semester and now I don't know what to do with the unfinished project.
Maybe I will create an iOS / Android client for it, because I'm really bad at HTML && CSS.
